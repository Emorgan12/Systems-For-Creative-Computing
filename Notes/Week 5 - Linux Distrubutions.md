On Ubuntu's website, there is a page which states their brand values. There are four of these: freedom, reliable, precise and collaborative. Ubuntu believes in the freedom to choose, to change and participate. Ubuntu states it is reliable and trustworthy. They say that you can depend on it, and the people who make it as they keep their promises. They also explain that there is beauty is the precision of the process and product, which is developed using crisp and clean engineering and attitude. According to the page, working together is at the heart of ubuntu. They describe themselves as 'the essence of humanity towards others.'

Previously, I used Ubuntu daily as my main OS for a few months. I found that the installation and general use was straightforward with little difficulty in doing majority of standard tasks. I installed Ubuntu using a USB stick, which was formatted using the Raspberry Pi Imager.

The performance was much better than Windows 11. It generally ran smoother and faster, even with many windows open. For context, the laptop I used had an i3-1215U with 8GB of RAM. Certain games, such as Roblox also ran smoothly.

However, installing games was a challenge. I found that proton often didn’t work or would require a lot of configurations to run games. Also, the EA launcher, which previously worked using Lutris, was updated and was no longer functional.

I moved back to Windows 11 because although performance is worse, due to bloatware, there is much more support and compatibility for almost all apps.
